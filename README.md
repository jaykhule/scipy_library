sciPy for Engineers: Simplifying Scientific Computing This repository demonstrates how to use the SciPy library for solving real-world engineering problems. SciPy is a powerful Python library for scientific and technical computing, offering modules for integration, optimization, linear algebra, signal processing, and more.

Project Overview This project is designed to help beginners and engineering students understand and apply SciPy to practical problems. It includes:

Clear explanations of key SciPy modules. Simple, beginner-friendly examples of SciPy functionality. Practical applications in engineering and science. Key Features Numerical Integration:

Compute definite integrals of functions.

over a range. Linear Algebra:

Solve systems of equations. Perform matrix operations (inversion, determinants).

Optimization:

Minimize or maximize mathematical functions.

Signal Processing:
Filter noisy signals using advanced tools. Example: Applying a low-pass filter to smooth data. Interpolation:

Estimate intermediate values from discrete data points. Example: Interpolating between experimental data points.
